Welcome to Apache ACE
=====================

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to centrally
manage and distribute software components, configuration data and other
artifacts to target systems. It is built using OSGi and can be deployed in
different topologies. The target systems are usually also OSGi based, but
don't have to be.


Building Apache ACE
===================

Initial Setup
--------------

There are two ways of building and developing ACE: on the command line and
within Eclipse. Below are the requirements in case you want to be able to do
both:

1)  Install Java SE 7 (or later), which can be downloaded from
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

2)  Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the newly
    installed JDK location, and that your PATH includes
    %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or $JAVA_HOME/bin (unix).

3)  Install the latest version of Eclipse with the following plugins:
    * Subclipse;
    * BndTools;
    * TestNG.

Building
--------
The source distribution comes in two parts: the actual sources only, 
and the dependencies that you need to build everything. Unzip both
archives (replace `$VERSION` with the correct version, for example:
2.1.0):

    $ unzip apache-ace-$VERSION-deps.zip
    $ unzip apache-ace-$VERSION-src.zip
    $ cd apache-ace-$VERSION-src/

From the command line:

Note: make sure that your $JAVA_HOME environment property is correctly
set and points to a recent Java 7 JDK!

1)  Go into the source root directory and invoke the Gradle wrapper:
    $ ./gradlew build

2)  To generate the various binaries, you can optionally invoke:
    $ ./gradlew runbundles
    The binaries can be found in the `run-*/generated/executables/`.

Within Eclipse:

From the main menu in Eclipse, choose: "File -> Import..." and then
select "General -> Existing projects into workspace..." and select
your workspace folder. A list of projects should show up now. Import
them all, wait until Eclipse has built the project and you're ready
to start.

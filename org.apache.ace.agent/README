Work in progress


On downloads:

1) Download ared stored temp-files and as a result it is not possible to resume interrupted 
downloads from a new handle. This should be changed to storage in the data dir using names 
based in url so that they that can be discovered and resumed.

2) Download result provides access to the download through a File. To be more clean this 
should be an inputstream.


On events:

1) The EventsHandler/EventListener mechanism does not yet support a topic interest list like 
eventadmin does. This should be added as it will help reduce event load if we start throwing 
more.

2) To reduce the overhead of configuration lookup we should consider adding config changed
events that other components can register to.

3) At this point the only events are those posted by the DeploymentAdmin. We should think
about which agent events make sense and add them.
